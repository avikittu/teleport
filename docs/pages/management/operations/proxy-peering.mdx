## Prerequisites

Teleport Proxy instances must be able to reach each other over the network. Ensure
there are no firewall policies that would block communication between instances.

## Step 1/4. Upgrade to teleport `10.0`
Download Teleport `10.0` or later from the [downloads page](https://goteleport.com/teleport/download) or your enterprise portal
and follow the standard [upgrade procedure](https://goteleport.com/docs/setup/operations/upgrading/).

## Step 2/4. Enable Proxy Peering
Update your cluster's Auth Service configuration to set the tunnel strategy type
to `proxy_peering`.

```yaml
auth_service:
    tunnel_strategy:
        type: proxy_peering
        agent_connection_count: 1
```

This setting will indicate to agents that they are only required to connect to 1
Teleport Proxy instance as specified by the `agent_connection_count` field.

## Step 3/4. Restart the Auth Services
Restart all Teleport Auth Services running in the cluster to apply the new auth service
configuration.

## Step 4/4. Restart the Proxy Services
Restart all Teleport Proxy instances running in the cluster in order for Proxy Peering
specific services to start up.
